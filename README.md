# GetGreen-HipHopHacktivist
## Find community gardens, share projects.

This was an idea created by a group of 4 kids from the age 12-16, with the help from 2 tech mentors and 1 design mentor, during a half day Hackathon. We wanted to find ways to positively impact the environment. The public does not have information about environmental issues and what they can do to make a change. Our app helps people find ways to positively affect the community anddd jobs by providing information about community gardens in the area.
